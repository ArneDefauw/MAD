Freedom of Information Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) This page contains the answers to Frequently Asked Questions about FOI.
If you cannot find the answer to your question here or require further information please contact the FOI Unit What is FOI?
These rights mean that people can seek access to personal information held on them no matter when the information was created, and to other records created after 21 April 1998.
Do I need to make an FOI request to get information from the Department?
No, it is not necessary to make an FOI request to get information from the Department.
It is a policy of the Department to make as much information as possible available through information leaflets, publications and in response to enquiries.
General information requests can be e-mailed to info@education.gov.ie and information regarding publications can be emailed to press@education.gov.ie A link to the Department’s publications/reports is available at: http://www.education.ie/en/Publications/ How does FOI work?
The Act requires public bodies to respond to requests from the public for information they hold.
In most cases, public bodies must give their decision on a request within 4 weeks of receiving it.
A week is defined in the Act to mean 5 consecutive week-days, excluding Saturdays and public holidays (Sundays are also excluded as they are not considered week-days).
The Department’s FOI Publication Scheme as required under section 8 of the FOI Act, provides information in relation to the structure of the Department, its records and its decision making which may help you to identify areas within the Department relevant to your request.
The Scheme is available at the following link Will I be charged for requesting information under the FOI Act?
Charges may be applied for the time spent locating records and for any photocopying costs incurred by the Department in providing you with the material requested.
It is very unlikely that any fees will be charged in respect of personal records, except in cases where a large number of records are involved.
Section 27 of the FOI Act provides for fees.
Fees are currently set as follows in accordance with Statutory Instrument No. 484 of 2014 at link.

Any records necessary to the understanding of a current record even if created prior to 21 April 1998.
All staff records created after 21 April 1995.
Staff records created before that date may, in certain circumstances, also be accessible.
However, in order to allow for the proper conduct and functioning of Government business, it will sometimes be necessary to exempt from release certain types of information in some circumstances.
These exemptions, which are set out in the Act, include exemptions for records relating to: law enforcement and security, Government meetings, confidential and commercially sensitive information, personal information (other than information relating to the person making the request).
How soon can a person making a request expect a reply?
Under the Act, a request for records must be acknowledged within 2 weeks and, in most cases, responded to within 4 weeks.
A week is defined in the Act to mean 5 consecutive week-days, excluding Saturdays and public holidays (Sundays are also excluded as they are not considered week-days).
In some limited situations under the FOI Act the making of a decision could take longer than 4 weeks (e.g. if a third party is involved there may be an extension of 3 weeks before a reply issues).
If this occurs, you will be notified in writing.
If you have not received a reply within 4 weeks, you are automatically entitled to consider your request as having been refused and you may immediately appeal to this Department for a review on the matter (please see below).

In addition, he is protecting special needs services, which means there will be no reduction in the number of Resource Teachers or Special Needs Assistants (SNAs).
The DEIS scheme for disadvantaged schools is also fully protected with no overall changes to staffing levels or funding as a result of this Budget.
The DES current expenditure budget for 2013 is €8.514 billion.
Savings of some €90 million are needed for next year.
This is made up of €77 million of savings announced under last year’s Comprehensive Review of Expenditure, together with a further €13 million in order to meet upward pressures mainly associated with the pay costs for teachers and SNAs.“Given that four in every five euro in my Gross Current Budget is spent on pay and pensions, it has not been an easy task to identify the savings of €90 million needed.
However, I have sought as far as possible to meet the Programme for Government commitment to prioritise education and to protect frontline services,” said Minister Quinn.In order to promote fairness in funding second level schools, a 2 point increase in the pupil teacher ratio in fee charging second level schools will be introduced in September 2013.
There are currently 55 schools, out of 723 post primary schools, that charge fees ranging from €2,550 to €10,065 for day pupils.
At present the state pays the salaries of one teacher for every 21 pupils in these schools compared with one teacher for every 19 pupils in schools in the Free Education scheme.This will rise to 23:1 in schools that charge fees.
However, these schools have the resources, through fees charged, to employ teachers privately, an option which is not available to schools in the free education scheme.
A report on the analysis of the tuition income of fee-charging schools carried out by the Department will be published in the New Year. Two measures are being taken in order to reduce the substitution costs for teachers and SNAs in schools.
Firstly, sick leave referrals will be harmonised with those that apply in the civil service.
This will mean that schools will be required to refer teachers and SNAs to the occupational health service, the equivalent of the company doctor, after four weeks of sick leave.
Secondly, arrangements for maternity leave-in-lieu for teachers and SNAs will be revised, with teachers’ annual leave entitlements covered by school closures.
This move will not affect their statutory entitlement to 6 months’ fully paid maternity leave and to 16 weeks of unpaid leave.
A similar change will take place in respect of adoptive leave in lieu. By taking these two measures together, Minister Quinn has been able to save enough money to avoid having to reduce the number of teachers in mainstream schools. The PTR in Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) programmes is to be equalised with the PTR in mainstream second level schools, changing from 17:1 at present to 19:1.
However, the number of PLC places should not be affected. Participants on VTOS, Youthreach and FAS further education and training programmes who move from Jobseekers payments will no longer have their new payments increased to the maximum €188 per week, in cases where their Jobseekers allowance is less than this.
However, people under 25 will continue to receive a top-up rate of up to €160 per week.
While a reduction is necessary, given the difficult economic circumstances, there will still be a financial incentive for young people to take up further education and training opportunities.
This measure will be replicated by the Department of Social Protection in respect of the Back to Education Allowance Scheme. As Minister Quinn has already signalled, the student contribution at third level will rise by €250 in 2013 to €2,500 and by €250 for the following two years to a maximum of €3,000 by 2015.
The Budget will also see a 3% reduction in the income threshold for entitlement to student grants.
This threshold rose every year from 1997 to 2009, in line with average industrial earnings.
However, average incomes fell by 7.9% over the past few years but there has been no corresponding decrease in income thresholds for grant purposes since the economic downturn.
Minister Quinn has, however, been able to maintain the existing rates of grant support for those qualifying in 2013. Minister Quinn is seeking more prudent management of existing cash balances by the Higher Education Institutions by reducing their allocation on a one off basis by €25 million.
He is requesting the Higher Education Authority ensures this measure will not impact on frontline student services.
The Literacy and Numeracy Strategy continues to be rolled out, at a cost of €6.5 million in 2013.
The Schools Building programme for 2013 will see work begin on 50 projects for new schools and major extensions.
This will bring the number of planned major school projects on site in 2013 to 113 as part of an overall capital expenditure on schools of almost €370 million.
The roll-out of high-speed broadband to second level schools continues, with a further 200 schools expected to be connected by September of 2013.
The Action Plan on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary sector is being implemented, which will ensure greater parental choice.
When account is taken of these measures the Department of Education and Skills will require further savings of some €44 million in 2014 in order to live within the expenditure ceiling set for that year.Primary & Second Level staffing:At primary level the staffing schedule has been protected at 28:1.Similarly, at second level the staffing arrangements in all free schools have been maintained.
In DEIS schools this figure is 18.25:1 and in mainstream schools it is 19:1.Fee-charging schoolsAt a time of severely reduced resources, priorities have to be made.
In an effort to ensure fairness in the education system, the PTR in fee charging schools will rise by two points to 23:1 in September 2013.
A report on the analysis of the tuition income of fee-charging schools will be published in the New Year.
This report is expected to show that fee charging schools have considerable discretionary income and are best placed to manage with reduced public funding.
DEIS schoolsDelivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS) schools have been protected in this Budget.
There have been no changes to overall teacher numbers or funding for DEIS schools as a result of this Budget.
Special EducationSimilarly, the number of Resource Teachers (9,950) has been maintained as has the number of SNAs (10,575).
A total of approximately €1.3 billion will be spent on special education in 2013 – the same as in 2012.
Reducing the Cost of substitution for teachers & SNAsSick Leave:Civil servants are required to be referred to the occupational health service after four weeks of sick leave.
Up until now, schools have not been required to refer teachers and SNAs until 12 weeks and 8 weeks of sick leave respectively.
These sick leave arrangements will be made similar to those operating in the civil service and are estimated to save €4 million per annum in substitution costs. Maternity and Adoptive Leave in Lieu:Currently teachers and SNAs on maternity leave are entitled to an additional maximum of 30 paid absence days, in lieu of days during their period of maternity leave when the schools were closed.
This benefit was introduced at a time when paid maternity leave stood at 14 weeks, rather than the 26 weeks that currently operates and was to compensate for school closures which occurred during the maternity leave period.
The cost of covering the substitution for these absences in 2011/12 was approximately €20 million.
This arrangement, which is not available to other public servants or private sector workers, is to be ended.
This will not affect a teacher’s or SNA’s entitlements to 26 weeks’ paid leave and an optional 16 weeks’ unpaid maternity leave.
A similar change will be made in respect of adoptive leave in lieu.
The new measure will be introduced on May 1st 2013 in order to give some advance notice.
It will result in savings of €11 million in 2013 and €20 million in a full year.
FURTHER EDUCATIONPLC Pupil Teacher RatioThe PTR for Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) programmes will be harmonised with mainstream second level schools, from 17:1 to 19:1.
This will result in a reduction of 200 PLC teaching posts and a saving of €4 million in 2013 rising to €12 million in a full year.
However, there should be no adverse impact on the number of PLC places available. Reduce supports to Further Education & Training (FET) scheme participantsCurrently, jobseekers who enrol in VTOS, Youthreach and FAS training schemes can have their Jobseeker payments (personal rate) increased to the maximum €188 per week, in cases where their jobseeker payment is less than this.
This arrangement will be discontinued in January, with jobseekers who move on to these schemes remaining on their existing rate of payment.
However, people under 25 will continue to have their payment increased up to a maximum of €160.
This decision has been taken as it is no longer considered necessary to provide a financial incentive to people to take up FET places.
The measure will apply to new entrants and will save €10.5 million in 2013 and €21 million in a full year.
The measure is being replicated by the Department of Social Protection in relation to the Back to Education Allowance scheme. Reduce allocations to VECs in 2013The 2013 allocation to the VECs will be reduced by €13.2 million. Notwithstanding the reduction, there will be no reduction in the level of services provided in 2013.
However, VECs will be required to manage within their existing cash reserves on hand. TARGETED SKILLS PROVISIONIn 2013, the National Training Fund expenditure will see provision of:€20 million for a further call under the Labour Market Education and Training Fund, which will be targeted at the long-term unemployed and will deliver some 6,500 places in 2013;€23 million in respect of the Springboard initiative to increase the part time higher education opportunities for unemployed people; and€5 million for a second phase of ICT Skills Conversion courses.
These were introduced earlier in 2012 as part of the joint industry-Government ICT Action Plan aimed at building the supply of high-level ICT graduates.HIGHER EDUCATIONStudent contributionAs already signalled, the student contribution will rise by €250 in 2013, 2014 & 2015 to a maximum of €3,000.
This will raise €18.5 million next year and €37 million in 2014.
All students who are eligible for student grants will continue to have the student contribution paid on their behalf.
At present two out of five students are in receipt of some form of student grant.
The rates of maintenance grants are being protected in this Budget.There will be a 3% reduction in the income thresholds used when calculating entitlement to student grants in 2013.
Between 1997 and 2009, the income limits were increased by an average of 4.7% each year, in line with average industrial earnings.
However, the income limits over the past three years have remained unchanged, despite an estimated drop in the average industrial wage of approximately 7.9%.
The 3% reduction will be applied to the income thresholds for all students from September 2013 for the 2013/2014 academic year.
It will see the threshold for the maximum standard rate of grant reduce from €41,110 to €39,875 and save €2 million in 2013, rising to €5 million in a full year.
Approximately 8% of the total estimated 80,000 grant recipients will be affected by the measure.Reduce allocation to higher education institutions (HEIs) in 2013Similar to the measure applying to the VEC sector, next year the allocation to the HEIs will be reduced by €25 million.
However, the institutions will be expected to deliver the same level of student services and manage this reduction through the use of existing cash reserves held by them.Resourcing special projectsThe Literacy and Numeracy Strategy, a key priority of the Government, continues to be rolled out and will cost approximately €6.5 million in 2013.The New Junior Cycle Framework, announced earlier this year, will be funded to the tune of €3 million in 2013.
The roll-out of high speed broadband continues, with a further 200 schools expected to be connected by September 2013.
All second-level schools will receive high-speed broadband at no cost to themselves by Sept 2014.
The Schools Building programme for 2013 will see work begin on 50 projects for new schools and major extensions.
This will bring the number of planned major school projects on site in 2013 to 113 as part of an overall capital expenditure on schools of almost €370 million.
Previous Budget Measures impacting in 2013Certain teacher allocation measures introduced in earlier Budgets will also impact on teacher numbers in 2013.
These include the changes in Budget 2012 announced to the staffing schedules for smaller primary schools with up to 4 teachers.
This change will have a target yield of some 75 posts in 2013.
This represents an estimated net increase of about 1.4% on overall teacher numbers for the 2013/14 school year compared to the current 2012/13 school year.
Capitation grantsAs a result of school funding measures introduced in Budget 2012, funding for capitation and related grants to schools in 2013 will be reduced by 0.5% for primary schools and by 2% for post-primary schools (in 2012 capitation payments were reduced for primary schools by 3.5% and by 2% for post-primary schools).
The overall saving will be achieved by a reduction in the standard capitation rates only, and other related grant rates will remain unchanged.
The new standard capitation rates will be €176 for primary and €306 for post-primary.
Capitation rates in VTOS and PLC colleges are also being reduced by 2%, while HEIs will see reductions in core-pay and non pay funding of 2%. Performance Budgeting – New Estimates FormatThe Department’s 2013 Estimate will reflect the new Performance Budgeting format that has been introduced for Government Departments.
The change to the Performance Budgeting format is an important element of the Public Sector reform process and seeks to strengthen the focus that the annual Estimates will have on actual outputs and outcomes that Departments will deliver with public funds, based on the objectives and goals contained in the Departments’ Statement of Strategy.
In addition to the high level expenditure information for the Education and Skills Vote published with today’s Budget, more detailed information regarding the 2013 Estimate is being published on the Department’s website.ENDS

5 The decision on whether to award the critical illness provisions is one for the employer.
Whilst the employer must primarily consider the OHS advice, the employer should consider all the circumstances of the case.
In this regard, although an employee does not meet the medical criteria, an employer may still make a decision to award in exceptional circumstances.
In exercising this discretion the employer must demonstrate the reasons why they are awarding the critical illness provisions.
Where the critical illness provisions are not awarded, the decision letter will include details of the appeals process set out on Page 7 of this manual.
3 Employers are required in the case of an employee with a disability-related illness to take all reasonable steps in terms of making an accommodation to facilitate the employee’s return to work consistent with, for example, OHS advice and service requirements.
6 Critical Illness Appeal An employee may appeal the decision to refuse the critical illness provisions in accordance with the procedures detailed below.
The Critical Illness Protocol and the Grievance Procedure for the relevant sector must be read in full prior to submitting an appeal.
In order to appeal the critical illness decision, an employee must apply to the employer in writing, setting out whether he/she is appealing the medical or the employer decision, within 30 days of receipt of the original critical illness decision.
Appeal of the employer decision: If the employer decision is being appealed the Grievance Procedures for the relevant sector must be followed.
Appeal of the medical decision: A number of registered specialists in occupational medicine, who are suitably qualified to assess medical fitness for work, have been selected and approved by the OHS and the Chief Medical Officer of the Civil Service to provide an appeal mechanism for employees who wish to appeal the critical illness medical decision.
An employee may appeal the medical decision in accordance with the following procedures The employee writes to the employer within 30 days of receipt of the original critical illness decision setting out the grounds for appeal.
The appeal must only be based on the medical information presented to the OHS in the employee’s original application.
It is not possible to submit new medical evidence at this point of the process.
The medical decision can only be appealed in relation to the employee’s medical condition (in the context of the critical illness medical criteria set out on page 7) and only if the employee has been deemed medically unfit for work by the OHS.
The employer will refer the appeal to the OHS who will then refer the case to one of the independent registered specialists in occupational medicine.
This appeal will ordinarily be a file only review.
The cost of the appeal assessment is set at €100 and will be borne by the employee.
If the appeal is successful the cost of the assessment will be refunded by the OHS.
Employees when making an appeal must forward to the employer a postal order/bank draft or cheque for the full cost of the assessment made payable to “Medmark Ltd. – CIP Appeal Account”.
The result of the approved registered medical practitioner’s assessment will be notified to the employer for action and the OHS for record purposes.
The final decision on the appeal lies with the employer, having considered the medical advice.
7 Ill Health Retirement An employee may decide to apply for ill-health retirement pension benefit having developed a medical condition and formed the view that’s/he is permanently incapacitated and that the medical infirmity is likely to be permanent.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOLLOWING THE AWARD OF PENSION 1.
Payment of Pension It is important to note that any queries you may have on the actual payment of pension must be directed to Retired Staff Payroll and not the Pensions Unit.
Pensions are paid fortnightly to the nominated bank account by: Retired Staff Payroll, Department of Education and Skills, Cornamaddy, Athlone.
Contact Details: Phone 090-6483995 email : rtps@education.gov.ie.
Income Tax Pensions are subject to Income Tax deductions in the normal way.
Tax is calculated based on a pensioner's gross pension less the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR).
The amount of tax deducted is determined by the pensioner's Tax Credits and Cut off point which, in turn, are determined by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.
It is a matter for you to examine your Tax Credit Certificate each year to ensure that it is correct.
The Department of Education and Skills acts on instruction from the Revenue Commissioners and cannot alter tax details.
All queries regarding tax must be directed to your local tax office or to the Revenue Commissioners website: www.revenue.ie In any communication with your local tax office, you must provide your PPSN, pension number/payroll number and quote the Pensions Payroll Employer’s Registered Number which is 4001495U.

Detailed information is available in Universal Social Charge FAQ on Revenue website at www.revenue.ie Corr na Madadh, Baile Átha Luain, Co. na hIarmhí, N37 X659 Cornamaddy, Athlone, Co.
Westmeath, N37 X659 T +353 9064-83600 | pensions@education.gov.ie 4.
Pay-Related Social Insurance (PRSI) Credits It is advisable for persons in receipt of pension who are under age 66 (the current eligible age for the State Contributory Pension) to enquire with the local Social Protection Office (Employment Exchange/Office), about PRSI Credits.
These credits may protect entitlement to certain Social Welfare Benefits such as the Survivor's Contributory pension.
Further information on PRSI credits may be obtained from the Department of Employment Affaires and Social Protection. website at www.welfare.ie 5.
Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR) The Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR) came into effect on 1 January 2011 for all pensions in payment on that date and awarded up to 29 February 2012 in accordance with the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Act 2010.
A further reduction was imposed on 1st July 2013.
The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2015 lessen the impact of the PSPR on PSPR-affected pension from 1st January 2016 and 1st January 2017.
(Further lessening of the impact of PSPR is intended to apply from January 2018).
That Circular can be accessed on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform website at: http://circulars.gov.ie/pdf/circular/per/2015/18.pdf Updated: July 2018 ….. 2 The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has, in addition, published a “Frequently Asked Question” document relating to PSPR which can be accessed by following the link at the following website: http://per.gov.ie/en/faq-documents/ 6.
Aggregation of pensions for PSPR From 1 September 2013, PSPR applies on the aggregate amount of pensions where a person is in receipt of two or more public service pensions (on foot of membership of one or more public service pension schemes or as the Spouse/Civil Partner of a deceased public servant) and where: a) all pensions are subject to the same PSPR rates, and b) the combined gross annual value of all pensions (before PSPR deduction) exceeds €32,500.
Therefore, a recipient of more than one public service pension is in the same position as a pensioner who has just one such pension equal to the combined value of his/her pensions. Voluntary deductions While a facility exists to have voluntary deductions (e.g. Car Plan, Insurance, etc.) made for teachers who are paid on the Salary Payroll, this facility is not available on the Pensions Payroll system.
The Pensions Payroll system provides a facility for V.H.I contributions and Credit Union payments.
7.1 Voluntary Health Insurance – VHI Healthcare If you wish to have deductions made from Pension Payroll, arrangements are made with VHI Healthcare, IDA Business Park, Purcell’s Inch, Dublin Road, Kilkenny.

They will require the Pensions Payroll Employer’s Registered Number which is 4001495U.
7.6 Others If you have had other deductions made from your salary as a serving teacher you should contact the individual organisation concerned to make alternative arrangements for future payments.
8.2 Pension Abatement - Employment subsequent to retirement Abatement is the cessation or reduction as appropriate, of occupational pension in payment where a public servant (including a teacher) who has retired with a public service pension re-enters employment in any area of the public service.
4 The Public Service Pension (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012 broadens the scope of abatement in regard to all pensioners who return to work in the public service.

The maximum fee amount on which a refund will be made is €5000.
The funding for this scheme is conditional on the budget allocated to the Department of Education and Skills.

School type proposed An Foras Pátrúnachta proposes the establishment of a multidenominational, co-educational, Irish medium school.
Educational Society of Ireland Profile of applicant Educational Society of Ireland commenced operation in 2004.
It comprises people from various different backgrounds and ethnic origins familiar with the educational system either professionally, academically, as business people or as parents.
The legal status of the organisation is not known.
It is involved in a home school study program and core and enrichment classes.
The organisation supports high achievers.
The Educational Society of Ireland is not a recognised patron currently.

School type proposed Educate Together proposes a multi denominational school which would co-educational teaching through the medium of English.
Demographic information Child benefit data for the area suggests that 445 children could commence primary school in 2014.
This compares with 336 pupils enrolled in junior infants for the 2012/13 school year, which is a difference of 109 pupils.
3 Assessment of applications 1.
Educational Society of Ireland – applicant has confirmed that it will comply with all of the requirements as set out above.
Educate Together – applicant has confirmed that it will comply with all of the requirements as set out above.
An Foras Pátrúnachta – the model proposed by An Foras is an Irish-medium, multi-denominational, co-educational school.
As 80% of the schools in the area are of a Catholic ethos and there is only one multi-denominational school, the model proposed by An Foras will represent a further expansion of diversity in the area in terms of ethos as well as in terms of providing Irish-medium education, not currently catered for.
Educational Society of Ireland (ESI) – there is one multi-denominational school in the area.
An Foras Pátrúnachta – while there is one multi-denominational school in the area currently, only 13% of school-going children in the area are attending this school.
The model proposed by An Foras will represent a further expansion of diversity in the area in terms of ethos, as well as in terms of providing Irish-medium education, which is not currently catered for.
Educational Society of Ireland (ESI) - will provide for expansion of diversity of ethos in the area.
Educate Together – will provide for expansion of diversity of ethos in the area. (e) Has the applicant patron demonstrated that there is a demand for this type of school in the area (Comment on the applicant’s demonstration of parental demand for the school type proposed.
Take into consideration the extent or range of diversity offered across existing schools in the identified area, having regard to the views of parents) The details of parental demand for the various models are set out below.
8 An Foras Pátrúnachta Sandymount Ringsend Area Junior Infant 2014 2015 2016 2 0 1 Outside of Sandymount Ringsend Junior Infant Area 2014 0 2015 0 2016 1 On the basis of this level of parental preference, An Foras has not demonstrated a viable demand for its model.
Educational Society of Ireland (ESI) Sandymount Ringsend Area 2016 2017 2014 2015 Junior Infant 19 11 19 5 Outside of Sandymount Ringsend Area Junior Infant 2014 2015 2016 2017 0 2 1 0 The parental preferences presented for this model are not particularly strong.
The figures suggest that the model would struggle to become a single stream school (up to 2 streams are expected to be required to meet the projected demographic need of the area).
Indeed, given that there would be insufficient enrolments for a full class group in any of the years between 2014 and 2017 inclusive, it likely that mixed classes would arise.
This would be unusual in a large urban setting and it underscores that the level of demand is not particularly strong for this model.
In any event, the potential enrolment for 2014 would be sufficient, at a Pupil Teacher Ratio of 28:1, for almost 4 streams at start up.
The level of parental preference suggests a two-stream intake up until 2017.
This profile demonstrates a very strong viable parental demand for this particular model of provision. (f) Has the applicant patron demonstrated that the school will, as a priority, cater for children in the area in which the school is located (or an area defined by the DES).
An Foras Pátrúnachta – States that it will adhere to the requirement to serve children within the area.
Educational Society of Ireland (ESI) – States it will adhere to the requirement to serve children within the area.
Educate Together – States that it will adhere to the requirement to serve children from within the area.
10 (g) If this area is to be served by a single school, can proposed school meet the needs of all pupils in the area.
Additional information provided by the prospective patrons An Foras Pátrúnachta The applicant submitted a comprehensive application in which the patron body refers to its track record of educational achievement through its network of schools, and its intention to comply with all of the Department’s criteria.
An Foras requests that the patronage establishment process be reviewed to take account of the special status of the Irish language and refers to the importance given to education in the 20 Year Strategy for the Irish Language.
It should be noted however, that this policy document states “Irish education will be provided to a high standard for school pupils whose parents/guardians require it.”
An Foras Pátrúnachta submitted only 4 parental expressions of interest for its school type (this includes one pupil from outside the area to be served by the new school).
Therefore, there is no evidence that education through the medium of Irish is required by parents/guardians in this particular area at this time.
The application refers to significant capacity issues in Gaelscoileanna in the wider area, with reference to children being unable to obtain places, but no evidence of this has been provided through parental expressions of interest from those areas.
Educational Society of Ireland (ESI) This applicant is not yet patron of any school in Ireland.
It has provided some detail regarding its advisory board, educational vision, ethos and also proposed curriculum, school policies and staffing structure but is has not provided any detail of its legal status.
Educate Together The applicant submitted a comprehensive application, covering its track record, and proven ability in the Irish education system, and proven adherence to the requirements of the DES in existing Educate Together schools.
Conclusions All prospective patrons have agreed to comply with the Department’s requirements for the establishment of the new school.
All 3 models would widen diversity in the area.
The An Foras Pátrúntachta model would provide all-Irish instruction in the area, which is not currently catered for.
However, with 3 prospective pupils between 2014 and 2016, An Foras has not demonstrated a viable parental demand for its model nor has it demonstrated that there is overflow demand from adjoining feeder areas.
The Educational Society of Ireland (ESI) has demonstrated a level of demand for its model but the level of demand presented is not strong enough to establish an 8-teacher school.
In this regard, the Department projects that a school of up to 16 teachers will be needed to meet the demographics of the area.
Educate Together has presented the strongest demand for its model.
Its parental preference is 5 times greater than that for the Educational Society of Ireland model and 95 times greater than that for the An Foras model.
Recommendation The evidence of parental preference for the Educate Together model is very strong and the Department recommends that patronage for the new school in this area should be awarded to Educate Together.

Primary Language Curriculum/Curaclam Teanga na Bunscoile INFANTS TO SECOND CLASS 1.
Introduction The new Primary Language Curriculum/Curaclam Teanga na Bunscoile for English and Irish has been developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA).
This curriculum is for teachers of pupils of all abilities in the junior primary years, i.e. from junior infants to second class inclusive.
It is for pupils in English-medium schools, Gaeltacht schools, Irish-medium schools and special schools.
There are, two versions of the curriculum: Primary Language Curriculum: English-medium Schools – for schools where English is the first language and Irish is the second language of the school. Curaclam Teanga na Bunscoile: Scoileanna Gaeltachta agus lán-Ghaeilge – for schools where Irish is the first language and English is the second language of the school.
The Primary Language Curriculum/Curaclam Teanga na Bunscoile has been developed by the NCCA in collaboration with the education partners.
Development was also informed by findings from curriculum reviews, commissioned research, public consultation and engagement with schools.
This means that it has the same structure and strands for English and Irish — Oral Language/Teanga ó Bhéal, Reading/Léitheoireacht and Writing/Scríbhneoireacht.
This integration between languages can help primary teachers to plan for and support children’s progression in the two languages.
The curriculum has four interconnected parts as shown below.
Learning Outcomes replace content objectives in the 1999 curriculum and describe the expected language learning and development for children at the end of a two-year period.
Progression Continua describe, in broad terms, milestones and steps in a child’s journey in his/her language learning and development.
Support Material replaces the Teacher Guidelines in the 1999 curriculum and includes practical advice illustrated with online digital resources, videos and photos, to inform teachers’ work in the school’s first and second languages.
Additional guidance regarding implementation of the new language curriculum in the SEN context will be included in the support material in due course.
2 The curriculum reflects the principles, practice guidelines, and focus on integration in Aistear: the Early Childhood Curriculum Framework (NCCA, 2009) and supports continuity between children’s learning and development in early childhood settings and in infant classes.
Immersion in Irish Medium or Gaeltacht Schools To facilitate the practice of immersion education in Irish-medium schools for learners of Irish, and to support continuity in the development of native speakers’ competence in the language, Irish medium schools and Gaeltacht schools may implement a period of total early immersion up to the end of senior infants.
Such a decision should be taken following consultation with the patron, teachers and parents’ associations and be subject to the approval of the school’s board of management.
Links to School Self-Evaluation Schools are advised to use the current process of school self-evaluation (SSE) when introducing the Primary Language Curriculum.
Schools should build on their collaborative experiences of looking at teaching and learning in literacy and numeracy in a focused way using the teaching and learning framework and the six-step school self-evaluation process to improve pupils’ language learning of English and Irish.
Schools will need to take particular account of their school context.
Schools are encouraged to identify from a whole-school perspective what is working well and areas of priority in relation to the introduction of the new approaches and emphases in the Primary Language Curriculum.
Targets and actions for improvement in relation to language teaching and learning can be identified in a school improvement plan.
The relevant curricular, assessment, learning-support and special education sections of the whole-school plan should be updated in line with the phased implementation of the Primary Language Curriculum.
The school self-evaluation website http://schoolself-evaluation.ie will continue to provide additional online resources and material for schools and teachers to support the continuing improvement of teaching and learning in schools and centres for education.
Implementation The new curriculum will be implemented on a phased basis from September 2016.
School Year 2016/17 There will be an initial emphasis on the Oral Language/Teanga ó Bhéal strand.
From September 2016, this strand will begin to be implemented for infants to second class.
School Year 2017/18 From September 2017 the Reading/Léitheoireacht and Writing/Scríbhneoireacht strands will begin to be implemented for infants to second class alongside the oral language strand.
School Year 2018/19 From September 2018, there will be full implementation of all strands for infants to second class.
School Year 2019/20 From September 2019, implementation of Primary Language Curriculum/Curaclam Teanga na Bunscoile for third to sixth class will begin.
Support for Schools and Teachers Continuing professional development (CPD) to support principals and teachers in the implementation of the new curriculum will be made available through the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST).
In line with the phased implementation approach, a three-year CPD framework is planned as follows:- Year 1 November 2015 to June 2016 Familiarisation with the curriculum and initial preparation for schools, introduction to and planning for teaching and learning using the learning outcomes and the progression continua of the oral language strand.
This will involve a) a half-day information seminar for school Principals (facilitated by PDST), followed by a half-day school closure for in-school, whole-staff CPD through use of on-line supports and b) one subsequent full-day seminar for school Principals and one other teacher (facilitated by PDST), followed by a half-day school closure for in-school, whole-staff CPD through use of on-line supports.
Substitution for attendance at seminars, where required, will be provided.
Year 2 School-year 2016/17 Support for implementation and enablement – Oral Language 4 This will involve one full-day school closure for in-school, whole-staff CPD (facilitated by PDST), combined with ongoing elective support for schools from a suite of CPD models.
Year 3 School-year 2017/18 Support for implementation and enablement – Reading and Writing This will involve one full-day school closure for in-school, whole-staff CPD (facilitated by PDST), combined with ongoing elective support for schools from a suite of CPD models.
In addition, PDST will continue to support schools on an ongoing basis by providing a suite of elective CPD models which schools and their teachers can choose from, based on their individual needs and contexts.
These include workshops, classroom modelling, summer courses, as well as website resources and publications.
Curriculum Publication From December 2015, an interactive version of the Primary Language Curriculum/ Curaclam Teanga na Bunscoile for infants to second class will be available online for teachers and schools to access at www.curriculumonline.ie/primary.
A hard copy of the curriculum for each teacher will be sent to schools early in 2016.
Teachers will also receive a USB key containing an extensive sample of the support material and examples published online.
A full suite of all materials will be available at www.ncca.ie by the end of 2015.

Circular 0065/2011 To: The Managerial Authorities of Recognised Primary, Secondary, Community, and Comprehensive Schools The Chief Executive Officers of Vocational Education Committees and Child Protection Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary schools 1.
Purpose of this circular The purpose of this circular is to advise school management authorities that, following consultations between the Department and organisations representing school management, parents and teachers, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Health Service Executive (HSE), revised Child Protection Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools have been drawn up and apply with immediate effect to all primary and post-primary schools.
General The new procedures are based on the recently published Children First – National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children 2011.
They incorporate significant improvements to the previous school guidelines that are intended to better ensure consistent and uniform implementation of Children First across all schools.
A summary of the main new elements of the procedures is set out at section 4 below.
The Child Protection Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools are published in an on-line format which can now be accessed on the Department’s website at www.education.ie > Child Protection.
Children First Children First – National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children 2011 was published in July 2011 and is available on the website of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs at www.dcya.ie.
A copy of Children First was also circulated by that Department to each school.
1 Schools may also wish to note for their information that the National Office for Children and Family Services of the HSE has also recently published a Child Protection and Welfare Handbook designed as a quick reference book to help support and standardise the work of social workers and other relevant practitioners in dealing with child protection and welfare cases.
It includes information on social work procedures and practice from referral through assessment to intervention.
This handbook is published on the website of the HSE at www.hse.ie.
Date Effective The Child Protection Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools apply with immediate effect to both primary and post-primary schools and replace previous guidelines issued in 2001 and 2004 respectively.
It is the responsibility of each relevant school authority to now put in place the necessary arrangements to ensure compliance with the Child Protection Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools.
A child protection policy template for use by schools for this purpose is set out at Appendix 1.
All primary schools must fully implement the Stay Safe programme.
There are improved oversight arrangements which are designed to ensure uniform and consistent implementation of Children First within the schools sector.
These have been introduced to strengthen and clarify the existing oversight arrangements in schools.
For ease of reference, the key improved oversight requirements introduced are summarised below.
These requirements should, however, be read within the context of the overall Child Protection Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools.
2 oo The name of the DLP must be displayed in a prominent position near the main entrance to the school. oo In addition to informing the school authority of those cases where a report involving a child in the school has been submitted to the HSE, the DLP shall also inform the school authority of cases where the DLP sought advice from the HSE and as a result of this advice, no report was made.
At each Board of Management meeting the principal’s report shall include the number of all such cases and this shall be recorded in the minutes of the board meeting. oo Each school must undertake an annual review of its child protection policy and its implementation by the school.
A checklist to be used in undertaking the review is included at Appendix 2.
The school must put in place an action plan to address any areas for improvement identified by the review.
The Board of Management shall make arrangements to inform school personnel the review has been undertaken.
Written notification, that the review has been undertaken shall be provided to the Parents’ Association (or where none exists directly to parents).
