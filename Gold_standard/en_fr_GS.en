Traders selling consumer goods in the European Union (EU) are obliged to remedy defects which existed at the time of delivery and which become apparent within 2 years.
EU rules guarantee consumers a minimum level of protection, especially if the goods do not meet the standards promised.
It harmonises those parts of consumer contract law on the sale of goods that cover legal guarantees* and, to a lesser extent, commercial guarantees* (warranties).
KEY POINTS Sellers must deliver goods to customers that conform with the sales contract.
To conform, goods must: comply with the sales description; be fit for the purpose for which the good was intended; and demonstrate the quality and performance that can reasonably be expected.
Sellers are responsible for any incorrect installation if that forms part of the contract.
This applies whether the work is under the seller’s responsibility or due to faulty instructions for the consumer.
Consumers have the right to ask for faulty goods to be repaired or replaced free of charge within a reasonable time and minimum inconvenience.
They may instead ask for an appropriate price reduction if repair or replacement is not done on time or without significant inconvenience to the consumer.
Sellers, who are liable to consumers for the goods they sell, may take action against producers if the fault is found to lie with them.
Sellers are liable for any faults in the goods that appear within 2 years from their sale.
However, EU countries may insist that consumers signal these to the seller within 2 months of discovering them.
Commercial guarantees must state the purchaser’s legal guarantee rights and be drawn up in plain, intelligible language.
Consumers may insist a guarantee is made available in writing.
EU countries may decide to exempt auctioned second-hand goods from the legislation.
The directive does not apply to water, gas, electricity or goods sold by an execution order or by legal authority.
KEY TERMS * Legal guarantee: the legal protection that a consumer has if goods prove to be faulty.
This does not depend on conditions in the contract. * Commercial guarantee: the willingness of the guarantor (often the producer) to assume personal liability for certain defects within a certain time period.

Ombudsman for rights of the child Address: Ombudsman for Children’s Office Millennium House 52-56 Great Strand Street Dublin 1 IrelandWebsite: http://www.oco.ie E-mail: ococomplaint@oco.ie Functions: The Ombudsman for Children’s Office (OCO) is an independent statutory body established in 2004 to promote and safeguard the rights and welfare of children and young people up to 18 years of age in Ireland.
It is a national human rights institution within the meaning of the United Nations Paris Principles on national human rights institutions.
The OCO is guided in its work by Ireland’s international human rights obligations, particularly those set out in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.
The Ombudsman for Children is independent in the performance of her functions and is accountable directly to the Oireachtas (Parliament).
The functions of the Ombudsman for Children’s Office are set out in the Ombudsman for Children Act, 2002.
With respect to the Office’s complaints-handling function, the 2002 Act sets out standard maladministration grounds for the review of complaints and the conduct of investigations.
Preliminary examinations or investigations may be instigated either on foot of a complaint received by the Office or on the Ombudsman for Children’s own initiative.
Given that the effect of an action on a child must be the subject of any investigation conducted by the Ombudsman for Children and that children themselves can bring complaints to the Office, the Act sets out specific legislative provisions which take account of the particular vulnerability of children: Obligation to have regard to best interests of the child Obligation to give due consideration to the child’s wishes.
Procedures: Once a complaint is made to the Ombudsman for Children’s Office, it will be examined to assess its admissibility and whether the nature of the complaint requires the complaint to be fast-tracked.
The OCO always seeks local resolution to complaints at the earliest possible stage and is obliged to afford the public body complained of the opportunity to address the complainant’s grievance in thfe first instance.
If a complaint is admissible, it will proceed to the stage of preliminary examination.
If, upon completion of a preliminary examination, it appears to the OCO that an investigation is warranted, it may proceed to investigate the complaint more fully.
Further information on the complaints procedure of the OCO may be found at: https://www.oco.ie/complaints/ Outcome: Upon the completion of an investigation, the Ombudsman for Children’s Office may make recommendations to the public body, school or hospital in question arising from its findings.
These recommendations may relate to ameliorating the situation for the child or children in question and/or making wider systemic changes in the interests of children.
The recommendations are not legally binding; however, one of the statutory powers of the OCO is to submit a special report to the Oireachtas (Parliament) in the event that a public body does not accept the OCO’s recommendations.
If necessary, files and records may be examined and officials questioned.
The Office of the Ombudsman will then decide whether: your complaint is valid, and you have suffered due to the action or decision of the public body.
In most cases, complaints are handled in an informal way.
The Office of the Ombudsman may discuss the problem directly with the public body or examine the relevant files.
In more complex cases, they may need to carry out a detailed investigation.
There is also an internal appeals process available to complainants who are unhappy with the outcome of their complaint.
Possible outcomes of the proceedings If the Office of the Ombudsman decide that you have suffered as a result of unfair or improper action by the public body, and the public body has not taken steps to put this right, they may recommend that it does so.
The Office of the Ombudsman may ask the body, if we consider it appropriate to do so, to: review what it has done, change its decision and/or, offer you:- an explanation,- an apology, and/or- financial compensation.
If the Office of the Ombudsman decides that your complaint cannot be upheld they will explain to you why they have reached this conclusion.

Legal Professions - Introduction The judicial arm of the state is exercised by the judiciary in accordance with Article 34 of the Constitution and certain legislation: primarily the Courts (establishment and Constitution) Act 1961 and the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961, as amended.
Judges are appointed from applicants from within the legal professions.
They are completely independent in the performance of their functions.
This independence is enshrined in the Constitution.
The legal profession is divided between solicitors (who concentrate on direct client work) and barristers (who specialise in advocacy and litigation).
Judges The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board identifies and informs the Government of the suitability of persons for appointment to judicial office.
The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board (JAAB) was established pursuant to the Court and Courts Officers Act 1995.
The board consists of the Chief Justice, the Presidents of the Court of Appeal, High Court, Circuit Court, and District Court, the Attorney General, nominated representatives of the Bar Council and the Law Society and three persons nominated by the Minister for Justice and Law Reform.
Judges are appointed by the President on the advice of the Government.
The judiciary are independent and are subject only to the Constitution and the law.
In accordance with the Constitution, the number of judges is fixed from time to time by legislation.
The Supreme Court comprises of the Chief Justice, who presides over the Court, and seven ordinary judges titled ‘Judge of the Supreme Court’.
The President of the High Court is also an ex officio member of the Supreme Court.
The High Court comprises of the President of the High Court who is responsible for the general organisation of the High Court’s work and ordinary judges titled ‘Judge of the High Court’.
The Chief Justice and the President of the Circuit Court are also ex officio members of the High Court.
The High Court is comprised of a President and 35 judges.
The Circuit Court comprises the President of the Circuit Court and 37 ordinary judges titled ‘Judge of the Circuit Court’.
The President of the District Court is also an ex officio member of the Circuit Court.
The District Court comprises the President of the District Court and 63 other judges titled ‘Judge of the District Court’.
Salaries of judges are fixed by legislation enacted from time to time.
Judges are appointed from the legal professions of qualified solicitors or barristers with certain years of practising experience (not research).
For the District Court, Section 29(2) of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961 provides that a person who is a practising barrister or solicitor of not less than ten years’ standing is qualified for appointment as a judge of the District Court.
Section 30 of the Courts and Courts Officers Act 1995 provides that a solicitor or barrister of ten years’ standing is qualified for appointment as a judge of the Circuit Court.
The Courts and Courts Officers Act 2002 provides that a person who is a practising barrister or solicitor of not less than 12 years’ standing is qualified for appointment to the High ,Court, Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court.
May God direct and sustain me."
Under the Constitution, Judges of the High Court and Supreme Court can only be removed from office for stated misbehaviour or incapacity after resolutions have been passed through both houses of the Oireachtas (Irish for Parliament).
The Courts of Justice Act 1924 and Courts of Justice (District Court) Act 1946 provide similar statutory provisions for judges of the Circuit and District Courts.
The Attorney General and The Director of Public Prosecutions The Attorney General is "the adviser of the Government in matters of law and legal opinion" as provided by Article 30 of the Constitution.
The Attorney General is appointed by the President on the nomination of the Taoiseach (Irish for Prime Minister) and is obliged to retire from office when the Taoiseach does.
The Attorney General is generally a practising barrister and a Senior Counsel.
There is no rule requiring the Attorney General to cease their private practice but this has been the case in recent years.
As the government’s legal adviser, the Attorney General scrutinises all draft legislation that the Government intend to put before both the Oireachtas (houses of Parliament) in order to get passed into law.
The Attorney General also advises the government on international matters such as the ratification of international agreements.
Another function of the Attorney General is to represent the public in the assertion of public rights.
This is done by initiating or opposing legal proceedings.
Although appointed by the Taoiseach, the Attorney General is independent of the Government.
In terms of the Constitution, the Attorney General is always the main defendant where the constitutionality of legislation is challenged.
Before 1976, all serious criminal offences were prosecuted in the name of the Attorney General.
The Constitution provides that this function can be carried out by another person authorised in law to act for that purpose.
The office of the Director of Public Prosecutions was thus created by s. 2 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1974 which came into effect in 1976 - the idea being to have an officer, independent of political connections to discharge these functions.
The Director is appointed by the Government but is a civil servant so the Director does not resign when a government falls, unlike the Attorney General.
This ensures continuity in the prosecution of offences.
The 1974 Act also provides that the Director of Public Prosecutions is to be independent in the performance of their duties.
The Director may be removed from their position by the Government, but this is only after a report has been conducted on their health or conduct by a committee comprising the Chief Justice, a judge of the High Court and the Attorney General.
The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP therefore makes the decision whether a person should be charged with a serious criminal offence and what the charge should be.
All offences are taken in the name of the DPP but most of the less serious crimes can be prosecuted by the Gardaí (Irish police force) without sending a file to the DPP.
In these cases, the DPP has the right to advise the Gardaí on how to deal with the case.
Although the DPP has taken over the Attorney General’s role in the prosecution of cases, the Attorney General retains it in relation to cases of an international nature such as extradition.
Employees of the Courts Service Court Registrars and Court Clerks are employed by the Courts Service Clerks of the Court are responsible for the general administration of the courts.
A Court Registrar’s main function is to assist the judge during the course of a court sitting and ensures that the administration necessary for the smooth running of the courts is managed efficiently.
The Courts Service is an independent corporate body that came into existence in November 1999 and was established by the Government under the Courts Service Act, 1998.
The Courts Service is accountable to the Minister for Justice and Equality and, through the Minister, to the Government.
Sheriffs are appointed under the Court Officers Act 1945 and s.12(5) of the Act limits the appointment of the position to persons who are barristers or solicitors who have practised for five years or to those who have acted for not less than five years as managing clerk or principal assistant to an under-sheriff or sheriff.
Section 12(6) (g) of the Act states that the conditions of employment of every Sheriff subject to foregoing sections of the Act are determined from time to time by the Minister for Finance after consultation with the Minister for Justice and Equality.
Solicitors The Law Society of Ireland has control over the education of students who want to become solicitors and has disciplinary powers over qualified solicitors.
The FE-1 examination consists of eight papers; Company Law, Constitutional Law, Contract Law, Criminal Law, Equity, European Union Law, the Law of Real Property and Tort Law.
The President has the power to suspend a solicitor from practice and to lift the suspension.
The Disciplinary Tribunal has the power to require repayments of funds to clients if they find a solicitor has overcharged.
Statutory Instrument 732 of 2003, the European Communities (Lawyers’ Establishment) Regulations 2003, provides that member state lawyers who wish to pursue the professional activities of a barrister or solicitor shall apply to the Bar Council or Law Society for registration to do so.
The application is considered and if accepted a registration certificate is issued.
An appeal from a refusal of the Bar Council or Law Society lies with the High Court.
Barristers The Honorable Society of King’s Inns provides post-graduate legal training, leading to the award of the degree of barrister-at-law, for those who wish to practice at the Bar as the profession is collectively known.
The King’s Inns operates as a voluntary society under the control of the Benchers of the Honorable Society of King’s Inns who are members of the judiciary and senior barristers.
Entrance to the degree course is by means of an entrance examination for graduates of the King’s Inns Diploma in Legal Studies or law graduates.
The length of the Diploma in Legal Studies course is two years (part-time) and the Barrister-at Law Course is a full-time one-year course or a modular two-year course.
On successful completion of the degree course, students are called to the Bar in the Supreme Court by the Chief Justice and the barristers called sign the roll of members of the Bar after the ceremony.
However, there are further requirements before they can engage in paid legal work.
Barristers must be members of the Law Library in order to practice.
The Law Library provides a place to work from and access to legal texts and materials in return for an annual fee.
Before becoming a member of the Law Library, a barrister has to select a master - an established barrister with at least five years’ experience.
While under the master’s guidance, which is generally for a year, the newly qualified barrister is known as a devil.
The master introduces the devil to the practical work of a barrister and will usually ask the devil to assist with the drafting of court pleadings, legal research and to attend court on their behalf.
The General Council of the Bar of Ireland, which is a non-statutory body, oversees the conduct of barristers.
The Council is elected annually by members of the Bar and issues a Professional Code of Conduct, which is amended from time to time by members of the Bar.
This Code of Conduct lays down what is required of barristers.
Allegations of breaches of the Code of Conduct are investigated by the Professional Practices Committee of the Bar Council, which includes non-members of the Bar.
The Committee has the power to issue fines and admonishments and to suspend or exclude a member from the Law Library.
Appeals from their decisions can be made to the Appeals Board, which includes a Circuit Court judge and also includes a lay member.
A barrister was traditionally required to receive instructions from a solicitor and direct access to barristers was prohibited.
This practice was examined by the Fair Trade Commission who in its 1990 report recommended that the blanket ban on direct access was a restrictive practice and should be deleted from the Code of Conduct.
The Commission did accept that in certain cases the continued involvement of a solicitor was desirable.
The Commission recommended that there should be no statutory or other rules requiring the physical attendance of a solicitor in court to instruct a barrister.
These recommendations have not been implemented in full but a number of amendments were made to the Code of Conduct to allow direct access from certain Approved Professional Bodies.
Barristers are either junior or senior counsel.
The tradition is for members of the Bar to practice as junior counsel for a number of years before considering whether to become senior counsel.
It is not a matter of automatic promotion, and some junior counsel will choose never to apply.
In general, most barristers consider becoming senior counsel after 15 years’ practice.
Those who wish to become senior counsel apply to the Attorney General for approval but the actual appointment is made by the Government on the advice of the Attorney General who also liaises with the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Chairman of the Bar Council.
In general, junior counsel draft and prepare pleadings and conduct some court cases, generally in the lower courts but not exclusively so.
A senior counsel’s functions would include scrutinising draft pleadings prepared by junior counsel and conducting the more difficult cases in the High and Supreme Court.
County Registrars County registrars are qualified solicitors and are appointed by the government.
They perform quasi judicial functions in relation to the circuit court, and are responsible for the management of the circuit court offices.
They also act as County Sheriff (except in Dublin and Cork).
Notaries Notaries Public are appointed by the Chief Justice sitting in open court.
The Notary Public discharges the following principal functions: Authentication of documents Attesting and verifying of signatures on documents Execution of notarial protests in respect of commercial documents such as bills of exchange and promissory notes, and of maritime matters Taking of affirmations, declarations and (save in respect of proceedings before the Irish courts) affidavits.
Applications are made by petition showing the residence and occupation of the Petitioner, the number of Notaries Public in the district, the population of the district and the circumstances showing the necessity for a Notary Public and/or how a vacancy has occurred.
The Petition must be verified by affidavit of the Petitioner in which is exhibited a certificate of fitness generally signed by six local solicitors and six leaders of the local business community.
The petition is brought before the Chief Justice by Notice of Motion which is served through the Supreme Court Office on the Registrar of the Faculty of Notaries Public in Ireland, The Secretary of the Law Society and all Notaries Public practising in the applicant’s counties and adjoining counties.
The general practice is to appoint Solicitors only as Notaries Public.
When a person, who is not a Solicitor, applies to be a Notary Public, the Law Society will require that an undertaking be given by the Petitioner to the Chief Justice not to engage in conveyancing or in legal work usually performed by a solicitor.
For all petitioners to be appointed a Notary Public, they must first pass an exam set by the Faculty of Notaries Public in Ireland.
Note: Queries on the current remuneration of the Attorney General, Director of Public Prosecutions, Clerks of the Court and Sheriffs can be emailed or posted to; Human Resources,Department of Finance,Merrion Street,Dublin 2.
Barristers are self-employed and their earnings vary greatly.
Solicitors can be self-employed (by owning their own practices) or employees and their earnings vary greatly as well.
Notaries charge a fee per document notarised.
There is no legislation governing the fee charged but notaries generally charge on the basis of time, travel and the amount a professional would be expected to charge for a service.

If a third person can show that it could not have had knowledge of the data or of the content of the documents, the registered company may demand the data and the content of the documents within 15 days of the date of publication of the data, and in the case of documents, of the date of notification of deposit of the document.
After this period, the registered data and the content of the documents deposited can thus be demanded vis-à-vis every person.
In the event of a discrepancy between the registered and published data or the content of the documents deposited and published, the registered company may only demand the published version vis-à-vis third parties.
However, it may demand them if it is shown that a third party had knowledge of the content of the registered data or the content of the document deposited.
History of the Slovak commercial register The register provides information filed from 1 January 2001.
The commercial register was established in 1992 following the adoption of Act No 513/1991, the Commercial Code, and replaced the previous company register.
The Commercial Code (Sections 27-34) amended the scope of the commercial register up until 2004.
From 1 February 2004, new legal requirements were introduced for the commercial register and entered into force (amendment of Act No 530/2003 on the commercial register and Act No 530/2003 as amended [sic]).
The only section of the Commercial Code still valid governs the legal description of the person registered, the effectiveness of the data recorded and its publication.
Sections 28 to 34 have been repealed.
The amendment of Act No 530/2003 introduced electronic publication of the register.
The updated documents are kept in paper and electronic format.

1 What are the conditions for obtaining a divorce?
The court issues a divorce decree, determining whether one of the spouses is responsible for the break-down of the marriage and, if so, which spouse.
If both spouses so request, the court does not rule on responsibility.
A divorce is not conditional upon earlier separation.
2 What are the grounds for divorce?
The grounds for divorce are that a marriage has broken down completely and irretrievably.
Both conditions must be met (Article 56(1) of the Family and Guardianship Code).
A divorced spouse is free to remarry.
3.2 the division of property of the spouses Joint property of the spouses, covering the property they acquire, is established by law upon marriage (statutory joint ownership).
Statutory joint ownership ceases when a marriage is dissolved, i.e. when the divorce decree dissolving a marriage becomes final.
At the request of one of the spouses, the court may divide the joint property in the divorce decree.
The acquired property of the spouses consists of items of property acquired by one or both spouses throughout the duration of statutory joint ownership.
Both spouses have equal shares in the joint property.
For important reasons, either spouse may request the court to divide the joint property according to the extent to which each spouse has contributed to the acquisition of that property.
Furthermore, where the spouses share accommodation, in the divorce decree the court determines how the accommodation is to be used while the divorced spouses continue to share it.
If both spouses so request, the court may divide the shared accommodation or award the accommodation to one of the spouses if the other spouse agrees to leave it without replacement accommodation being provided.
3.3 the minor children of the spouses In a divorce decree the court decides on the parental responsibility for any minor children of both spouses and on contact between the parents and the children. It also determines the amount to be paid by each spouse to cover the children’s maintenance and upbringing (Article 56(1) of the Family and Guardianship Code).
The court may entrust the exercise of parental responsibility to one parent, limiting the parental responsibility of the other parent to specific obligations and rights with regard to the child(ren).
3.4 the obligation to pay maintenance to the other spouse?
A divorced spouse who has not been found to be solely responsible for the break-down of the marriage and who is in financial difficulties may demand maintenance from the other spouse depending on his or her reasonable needs and the earning and financial capacities of the other spouse (Article 60(1) of the Family and Guardianship Code).
If a divorce entails a substantial deterioration in the financial situation of a spouse who is not responsible for the break-down of the marriage, the spouse who has been found to be solely responsible for the break-down of the marriage is required to provide funds to meet the needs of the other spouse, even if he or she is not in financial difficulties (Article 60(2) of the Family and Guardianship Code).
The maintenance obligation ceases when the spouse receiving maintenance remarries.
Where the spouse required to pay maintenance has not been found to be solely responsible for the break-down of the marriage, the obligation concerned ceases five years after the divorce (Article 60(3) of the Family and Guardianship Code).
4 What does the legal term “legal separation” mean in practical terms?
It is a formal separation, i.e. it is decreed by the court under Articles 611 to 616 of the Family and Guardianship Code.
5 What are the conditions for legal separation?
The condition for separation is finding that a marriage has completely broken down.
6 What are the legal consequences of legal separation?
The legal consequences of separation are the same as those of a divorce.
However, a separated spouse cannot remarry.
7 What does the term “marriage annulment” mean in practice?
‘Marriage annulment’ means the cancellation of all the effects of a marriage with retroactive effect, except for the status of children from an annulled marriage, who retain the status of children born in wedlock.
8 What are the conditions for marriage annulment?
Each of the aforementioned causes must have arisen when the marriage was entered into.
9 What are the legal consequences of marriage annulment?
A judgment annulling a marriage is constitutive and has consequences for third parties (erga omnes).
The consequences of marriage annulment for the relationship between the spouses and the children from their marriage and for property relations between the spouses are governed by the relevant divorce rules. Importantly, a spouse who entered into a marriage in bad faith is deemed to be the spouse responsible for the break-down of the marriage.
10 Are there alternative non-judicial means for solving issues relating to the divorce without going to court?
Spouses in Poland can turn to family mediation.
Its primary aims are to resolve conflicts between spouses in such a way as to avoid divorce or separation, and to work out the terms of a divorce (property issues, childcare) in an amicable manner.
Mediation services are provided mainly by non-governmental organisations, foundations and the Church.
Spouses who experience marital conflicts can benefit from various forms of family therapy and seek the assistance of psychologists, psychotherapists, support groups, etc.
11 Where should I lodge my application (petition) for divorce/legal separation/marriage annulment?
Which formalities must be respected and which documents should I attach to my application?
Applications for divorce, separation or marriage annulment must be lodged with the regional court (sąd okręgowy) having jurisdiction over the last common place of residence of the spouses. In the absence of such a court, applications must be lodged with the regional court having jurisdiction over the place of residence of the applicant.
A court fee is charged on such applications.
However, a party whose financial situation does not allow that person to pay the fee may apply to the court for full or partial exemption from the court costs, and may also request the court to appoint a lawyer ex officio for him or her.
The following documents must be attached to an application: copies of civil status documents (marriage certificate, children’s birth certificates), proof of earnings (income), document authorising a lawyer to represent a party (if that person has elected to choose his or her own lawyer) and any other certificates that may be relevant to the case (medical certificates, administrative decisions, etc.).
12 Can I obtain legal aid to cover the costs of the procedure?
Cf. point 11.
A person applying for full or partial exemption from court costs or ex officio appointment of a lawyer must attach to the application a statement of his or her financial situation (on the appropriate form, available from the court).
13 Is it possible to appeal against a decision relating to divorce/legal separation/marriage annulment?
Yes, in all these cases it is possible to appeal to a court of second instance. Spouses may appeal to appeal courts against the decisions of regional courts.
14 What should I do to have a decision on divorce/legal separation/marriage annulment issued by a court in another Member State recognized in this Member State?
In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 of 27 November 2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Brussels IIa Regulation’), such decisions are automatically recognised in Poland without any special recognition procedure being required (Article 21 of the Brussels IIa Regulation).
15 To which court should I turn to oppose the recognition of a decision on divorce/legal separation/marriage annulment issued by a court in another Member State?
Which procedure applies in these cases?
Any interested party may apply for a decision that a judgment be or not be recognised (Article 21(3) of the Brussels IIa Regulation).
In Poland, such applications are submitted to regional courts.
The local jurisdiction is determined by reference to the place of habitual residence of the person against whom an application for a decision that a judgment be or not be recognised is lodged.
If neither of the places referred to above is located in Poland, the local jurisdiction is determined by reference to the place of enforcement (Article 29(2) of the Brussels IIa Regulation).
16 Which divorce law does the court apply in a divorce proceeding between spouses who do not live in this Member State or who are of different nationalities?
Poland is a party to many international agreements that govern the above issue.
Such rules take precedence over Polish private international law.
Thus, different rules may be applicable whenever spouses are of different nationalities.
In the absence of an international agreement, the Private International Law Act of 14 February 2011 is applicable.
In accordance with Article 54 of this Act, a marriage is dissolved under the common native law of the spouses applicable at the time when a request for marriage dissolution is submitted.
In the absence of a common native law of the spouses, the applicable law is the law of the country in which both spouses reside at the time when a request for marriage dissolution is submitted. If the spouses do not share a place of residence at the time when such a request is submitted, the applicable law is the law of the last country in which both spouses shared a place of residence, provided that one of the spouses still has his or her habitual residence there.
In other cases, marriages are dissolved under Polish law.
Introduction The court fee in civil cases, which include the European order for payment procedure, is a State tax paid at the commencement of the proceedings upon application by a party.
It is also regulated by Royal Decree Law 1/2015 of 27 February 2015 on second-chance mechanisms, reducing the financial burden and other social security measures (Real Decreto Ley 1/2015 de 27 de febrero, de mecanismos de segunda oportunidad, reducción de carga financiera y otras medidas de orden social), which further amended Law 10/2012 cited above.
The fee should be paid through the Tax Agency (Agencia Tributaria) using a downloadable form to be completed as follows (click here) or by means of an application that is generated once the data have been filled in (click here) and which allows payment online (this option currently available only to large undertakings).
Payment should be made on submission of application form A. Payment can be made by the legal representative or lawyer (abogado) in the name and on behalf of the taxable person, in particular if the latter is not resident in Spain. A non-resident need not obtain a tax identification number prior to self-assessment.
The legal representative or the lawyer does not bear tax liability for this payment.
What fees are applicable?
If it is an enforceable procedural instrument, it is exempted from payment.
Similarly, all physical persons and legal entities that are entitled to legal aid are exempted as long as they can demonstrate that they meet the conditions for legal aid laid down in the applicable legislation.
How much shall I pay?
For the European order for payment procedure, the amount of the judicial procedure is the amount of the principal claim plus interest and contractual penalties.
For a European order for payment procedure of EUR 9 000 involving a legal entity, the fee would be EUR 100 + EUR 9 000 x 0.50 % = EUR 145.
What happens if I do not pay the court fees on time?
If proof of payment of the fee is not provided at the outset, the lawyer of the judiciary (Letrado de la Administración de Justicia) will request the taxpayer to provide such proof and will not process the claim form until it has been received.
Failure to submit proof of payment does not prevent application of the time limits laid down in procedural law, so if the fee remains unpaid after the lawyer's request, the procedural act will not be allowed to proceed and the proceedings will be continued or closed, as applicable.
How can I pay the court fees?
The fee must be paid by the self-assessment procedure prior to the submission of the procedural act by the relevant party.
The fee should be paid using official form 696 for self-assessment of the fee for the exercise of judicial power to be completed as follows (click here), or by means of an application that is generated once the data have been filled in (click here).
Payment can be made in person at any of the collection agencies. The form is available in Spanish and English.
Online payment is currently available only for large undertakings, via bank transfer, credit card, debiting from bank account, etc., as the legislation on fees was amended recently and a technical solution is not yet in place.
Court fees are included in legal aid, which is regulated in Law 1/1996 of 10 January 1996 on legal aid(Ley 1/1996, de 10 de enero, de asistencia jurídica gratuita), chiefly in Articles 1-8 and 46-51.
The relevant information is available at http://www.justiciagratuita.es/, via which legal aid can be applied for. Select the Bar Association (Colegio de Abogados) located in the place where the court that will deal with the matter is located.
What shall I do after the payment?
Form A must be accompanied by proof of payment of the fee as per the official form (paper or electronic), duly validated. It is not yet possible in Spain to send European payment order forms electronically. Proof of payment (whether received on paper or electronically) should be sent in paper form together with the other required documentation.
Once the option of electronic submission becomes available, there will be a 10 % reduction of the fee when this option is used.
The law provides for reimbursement of 60 % of the fee in the event of an agreement or acceptance of the claim putting an end to the dispute.
1 What do the concepts “maintenance” and “maintenance obligation” mean in practical terms?
Which persons have to pay a maintenance allowance to another person?
Maintenance is understood to mean everything necessary in terms of food, accommodation, clothing, and medical care.
Maintenance also includes the education and training of the maintenance creditor while he or she is a minor and even thereafter if he or she is still in education for reasons not attributable to him or her.
In the event of marriage breakdown, during the process of legal separation or divorce, maintenance may be claimed for children living in the home who are not financially independent.
Pregnancy and childbirth expenses shall be included in the maintenance, unless they are otherwise covered.
There is a mutual obligation to provide maintenance to the full extent between: 1. - Spouses.
2. - Ascendants and descendants.
Siblings should only receive necessary living assistance, where needed for any reason not attributable to the maintenance creditor, including, where necessary, assistance required for their education.
2 Up to what age can a child benefit from a maintenance allowance?
Are there different rules for maintenance concerning minors and adults?
For children, until they reach the age of majority, which in Spain is at 18 years, except where the minor has sufficient income of his or her own.
Beyond the age of majority, the obligation continues with respect to children for as long as they are not financially independent, have not completed their education or are out of work through no fault of their own.
For minors, it will also be necessary to take into account the articles in the Civil Code on the joint effects of marriage annulment, legal separation and divorce (Articles 90 and following).
While children are minors, the maintenance allowance is a priority and an unavoidable obligation.
3 Should I apply to a competent authority or a court to obtain maintenance?
What are the main elements of this procedure?
Applications should be submitted to the courts of law, the Courts of First Instance (Juzgados de Primera Instancia) having jurisdiction.
What are the key elements in the procedure?
Applications are processed through a juicio verbal (oral hearing).
If maintenance is claimed as a complementary measure to legal separation or divorce, or parent‑child measures in the event of a break-up of the couple, it is processed jointly with said proceedings, through a juicio verbal with some special features.
4 Can a request be made on behalf of a relative (if yes, what grade), or a child?
The claim must be submitted personally by the party concerned, except where the latter is a minor, in which case the application must be made by the person legally responsible for the minor, the public prosecutor’s office (el Fiscal) or the child protection agency.
However, the claim may be filed using representation, provided that the representative has been granted power of attorney in the presence of a notary, a court clerk or the consul at any Spanish diplomatic mission abroad.
5 If I plan to bring the case to court, how do I know which court has jurisdiction?
The general rule is that jurisdiction lies with the courts in the maintenance debtor’s place of residence.
If there is more than one joint debtor (mother and father), jurisdiction lies with the courts in the place of residence of either or any of them.
If the debtor is not resident in Spain, the courts in his or her last place of residence in Spain have jurisdiction.
In all other circumstances, the courts in the place of residence of the maintenance creditor have jurisdiction.
6 As an applicant, do I have to go through an intermediary to bring the case to court (e.g. a lawyer, central or local authority, etc.)?
If not, which procedures apply?
Claimants must be defended by a lawyer (Abogado) and represented by a legal representative or solicitor (Procurador).
7 Do I have to pay fees to bring a case to court?
If so, how much are they likely to be?
If my financial means are insufficient, can I obtain legal aid to cover the costs of the procedure?
In Spain there are no fees involved in claims solely intended to obtain maintenance payments, except for the fees charged by lawyers, legal representatives and experts, if used.
The fees charged by lawyers and legal representatives are based on the amount of the claim.
Financial assistance is available to cover court costs where the claimant or the person from whom maintenance is being claimed lack the financial means, and they may be entitled to legal assistance free of charge in accordance with the scales laid down in Article 3 of Law 1/1996 of 10 January 1996 on Free Legal Assistance.
Assistance consists of the provision of services by a court-appointed lawyer or legal representative to conduct the legal claim, and any court costs such as payments to expert witnesses or the costs of publishing decrees are also paid for by the State.
8 What kind of maintenance is likely to be granted by the court?
How is the amount of maintenance calculated?
Can the court's decision be revised, if living costs or family circumstances change?
If yes, how (e.g. by means of an automatic indexation system)?
In most cases regular payments are determined which, according to law, are required to be paid monthly in advance.
It is highly unusual for arrangements to be made for a single lump‑sum payment; this only occurs where maintenance arrears need to be paid off, when the debtor is an individual without fixed assets and this is the best way of protecting future payments, or by agreement between the parties.
In calculating the actual amounts of the payments to be made, the court uses an abstract legal rule based on proportionality in three aspects: the needs of the maintenance creditor; the financial means of the maintenance debtor; and the financial means of other persons also under an obligation to contribute to maintenance (co-debtors) to the same degree as the principal maintenance debtor.
The court decision setting the level of maintenance must lay down the basis upon which future updates will be made.
This updating is carried out automatically, triggered by the passage of time, and it is the person responsible for making the payment who must implement the updated amount.
If the maintenance debtor fails to update the maintenance payments, the court will do it, following a request by the maintenance creditor.
Finally, maintenance may no longer be due when the grounds for it have ceased to exist.
The General Council of the Judiciary (Consejo General del Poder Judicial, CGPJ) has drawn up tables for the calculation of maintenance allowances.
These are guidelines, based on the needs of the children, taking into account the income of the parents and the number of children in the family.
The cost of housing and schooling have been excluded from the calculation and therefore the final allowance must be adjusted taking into account these costs in each case.
See http://www.poderjudicial.es/cgpj/es/Poder_Judicial.
9 How and to whom will the maintenance be paid?
The usual form of payment is in money.
Maintenance is paid directly to the creditor.
The most usual method is by bank transfer.
Where the maintenance creditor is a minor or does not have legal capacity, the payment is made to his legal representative.
In proceedings relating to marriage breakdown or parent-child relationships, the courts allow as forms of payment of maintenance, direct payment to the creditor for certain expenses pertaining to a minor child (e.g. schooling, medical insurance, etc.) 10 If the person concerned (debtor) doesn't pay voluntarily, what action can be taken in order to force him/her to pay?
In such an event, the maintenance creditor may put forward a request for enforcement of the legal decision that declared that a right to maintenance payments existed.
In Spain there are the following means of enforcement: attachment of earnings (apart from a minimum subsistence amount as directed by the court); withholding of tax refunds; seizure of bank accounts; withholding of social security benefits; seizure of goods and public sale thereof; in certain cases where the maintenance payments are not made, this may constitute a criminal offence and the offender may be liable to imprisonment.
11 Please describe briefly any limitations on enforcement, in particular debtor protection rules and limitation or prescription periods in your enforcement system For maintenance payment debts, there are no quantitative limits on the seizure of the debtor’s accounts or his goods, in contrast to the situation for other debts.
Proceedings to enforce compliance with the following obligations may not be taken after five years have passed.
12 Is there an organisation or an authority which can help me to recover maintenance?
In cases of claims for maintenance payments to minors or persons lacking legal capacity, the Public Prosecutor’s Office may offer its representation.
13 Can organisations (government or private) advance the payment of maintenance wholly or partly in the debtor's place?
To be eligible for an advance from this Fund, it is essential that the decision recognising the maintenance was handed down by a Spanish court.
14 If I am in this Member State and the debtor has his/her residence in another country: 14.1 Can I obtain the assistance of an authority or private organisation in this Member State?
Yes, under European Union rules and international conventions on the payment of maintenance that Spain has ratified, a maintenance creditor may request the assistance of Spain's central authority, based within the Ministry of Justice.
14.2 If so, how can that authority or private organisation be contacted?
Through any means of contact, with the Department of International Legal Cooperation (Subdirección General de Cooperación Jurídica Internacional), within the Ministry of Justice.
Calle San Bernardo No 62, 28071 Madrid.
Telephone: 00 34 91 3902228/2295/4437. Fax: 00 34 91 3904457 15 If I am in another country and the debtor is in this Member State: 15.1 Can I address a request directly to such an authority or private organisation in this Member State?
A creditor resident in another Member State may contact the central authority of that state, providing evidence that he has been granted a right to maintenance payments, and request that the central authority contact the Spanish central authority and that the latter initiate enforcement proceedings in Spain. This shall be in accordance with European Union rules and international conventions on the payment of maintenance that Spain has ratified.
15.2 If so, how can that authority or private organisation be contacted and what kind of assistance can I receive?
Under the conditions laid down by the authorities in the relevant state.
16 Is this Member State bound by the 2007 Hague Protocol?
Yes, the European Union (and therefore Spain) ratified the protocol on 8 April 2010.
17 If this Member State is not bound by the 2007 Hague Protocol, which law will be applicable to the maintenance claim according to its private international law rules?
What are the corresponding private international law rules? 18 What are the rules on access to justice in cross-border cases within the EU following the structure of Chapter V of the Maintenance Regulation?
Under Council Regulation (EC) No 4/2009 of 18 December 2008 on jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition and enforcement of decisions and cooperation in matters relating to maintenance obligations, parties who are involved in a dispute covered by that regulation shall have effective access to justice in another Member State, including enforcement and appeal or review procedures, in accordance with the conditions laid down in the relevant chapter.
In addition, the requested Member State shall provide free legal aid in respect of all applications by a creditor under Article 56 concerning maintenance obligations arising from a parent-child relationship towards a person under the age of 21.
19 What are the measures adopted by this Member State in order to ensure the functioning of the activities described in Article 51 of the Maintenance Regulation?
It has added to Law 1/1996 of 10 January 1996 on free legal assistance a Chapter VIII entitled ‘free legal assistance in cross-border European Union disputes’, governing that right in relation to natural persons, whether they are European Union citizens or nationals of third countries who are legally resident in one of the Member States.
1 Under what circumstances may a parent lawfully remove the child to another state without the other parent’s consent?
A parent with sole custody can lawfully remove a child to another state without the other parent’s consent.
2 Under what circumstances is the other parent’s consent necessary for the child’s removal to another state?
Where both parents exercise joint custody of an underage child, the other parent’s consent is necessary to remove the child to another state.
Removal without consent also constitutes a criminal offence under Chapter 154 of the Criminal Code.
3 If the other parent does not consent to the child’s removal to another state, though it is necessary, how can the child be removed lawfully to another state?
A child can be removed to another state without the consent of one of the parents with joint custody on the basis of a relevant judgment by the family court.
4 Do the same rules apply to temporary removal (e.g. holiday, healthcare etc.) and permanent removal?
If applicable, please provide relevant consent forms.
In the absence of consent for temporary or permanent removal, a court judgment is required.
In the presence of consent, there is no specific document used to grant that consent.
Organisation of justice/judicial systems The judicial system in the Czech Republic consists of the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic and the 'ordinary' court system.
The ordinary court system consists of the Supreme Court (nejvyšší soud), the Supreme Administrative Court (nejvyšší správní soud), high courts (vrchní soudy), regional courts (krajské soudy) and district courts (okresní soudy).
Court administration The central state administrative body for the courts is the Ministry of Justice of the Czech Republic.
The Ministry of Justice administers the high courts, regional courts and district courts within the scope of Act No 6/2002 on law courts and judges, either directly or through the Presidents of the courts; the district courts may also administered by the Ministry of Justice through the Presidents of the regional courts.
Some central government tasks are carried out by the President of the Supreme Court of the Czech Republic (or the Vice-President where appropriate) and the President of the Supreme Administrative Court of the Czech Republic (or the Vice-President where appropriate).
The state administration of the courts is carried out taking into account the observations of the relevant Councils for the Judiciary established within the Supreme Court of the Czech Republic, the Supreme Administrative Court of the Czech Republic, the high courts, regional courts and all district courts.
Certain administrative activities are carried out by the administrative director of the court, who reports to the President of the court.
The special court system consists only of the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic.
Court hierarchy The Czech Republic has a two-instance system, which is a determining factor in the hierarchical organisation of the system of remedies.
From this point of view, the hierarchical relationship between the courts, based on the level of that branch within the judicial system, has three tiers.
Further information is set out in the section on the ordinary court system in the Czech Republic.
The Supreme Court also rules on: (a) the recognition and enforcement of judgments by foreign courts, where required by specific legislation or by an international treaty ratified by Parliament which is binding on the Czech Republic and has been promulgated; (b) other cases laid down by specific legislation or by an international treaty ratified by Parliament which is binding on the Czech Republic and has been promulgated.
The Supreme Court monitors and assesses the final judgments by courts in civil and criminal proceedings, and on the basis thereof, in the interests of consistent decision-making by the courts, delivers opinions concerning decision-making by the courts in particular types of case.
Pursuant to Act No 150/2002, the Code of Administrative Procedure: Supreme Administrative Court of the Czech Republic As the supreme judicial authority in matters relating to the jurisdiction of the courts in the administrative judiciary, the Supreme Administrative Court ensures the consistency and legality of decisions by ruling on applications for review in cases laid down by the Act and by ruling on other cases laid down by this or a specific Act.
The Supreme Administrative Court monitors and assesses the final decisions taken by courts in the administrative judiciary, and on the basis thereof, in the interests of consistent decision-making by the courts, delivers opinions concerning decision-making by the courts in particular types of case.
In the interests of legal and consistent decision-making by administrative authorities, the Supreme Administrative Court may, in cases laid down by this Act and using a procedure laid down therein, decide on a fundamental resolution as part of its decision-making activity.
Legal databases Justice Portal Portal of the Public Administration Is access to the database free of charge?
Both internet portals may be accessed free of charge.
Brief description of content The Justice Portal contains information on the Ministry of Justice, individual courts, the Public Prosecutor and their contact details.
The official government portal provides the legislation of the Czech Republic published in the Collection of Acts.
FINDING COMPETENT COURTS/AUTHORITIESThe search tool below will help you to identify court(s)/authority(ies) competent for a specific European legal instrument.
Please note that although every effort has been made to ascertain the accuracy of the results, there may be some exceptional cases concerning the determination of competence that are not necessarily covered.
The court serves a notice to the third party, informs the other party of the notification and sets a deadline for them to take a position.
If the notice satisfies legal requirements and the party justifies the need to add a third party, the court orders the third party to be added to the proceedings.
Under Estonian procedural law, a third party not making an independent submission takes part in the proceedings but is not one of the parties to the proceedings (applicant or defendant).
If it transpires that the third party has been added to the proceedings without justification, the court may order it to be excluded from the proceedings.
A third party not making an independent submission which has been added to or intervenes in proceedings on the side of the applicant or defendant should presumably support the position of the relevant party to the proceedings, i.e. put forward arguments in support of that party and have an interest in that party succeeding.
A third party not making an independent submission may take all procedural steps except those that can only be taken by the applicant or defendant alone; this includes appealing decisions taken in the case.
An application, complaint or procedural act by a third party has a legal effect on the proceedings only if this does not conflict with the application, complaint or act of the applicant or defendant on whose side the third party is participating in the proceedings.
When making a complaint or taking any other procedural step, the same deadline applies to the third party as to the applicant or defendant on whose side it is participating in the proceedings, unless the law provides otherwise.
2) What are the main effects of judgments on persons served TPN?
If a party submits an application to have a person added as a third party, but the court does not add the person to the proceedings or the person is excluded from third-party proceedings, that person is not legally bound by the ruling in the main proceedings.
If a party to the proceedings initiates proceedings against a third party not making an independent submission and relies on previous proceedings, the third party can also raise an objection which it raised in the proceedings as a third party and which contradicts the party's statements.
A third party may also object that it was not able to submit an application, objection, evidence or complaint because it intervened or was added to proceedings too late or was not able to submit them because of statements or actions by the applicant or defendant on whose side it participated in the proceedings.
It can also object that the applicant or defendant, unbeknownst to the third party, failed to submit an application, objection, evidence or complaint deliberately or by gross negligence.
3) Is there a binding effect with regard to the legal assessment in the main proceeding?
If a party submitted an application to have a person added as a third party, but the court did not add the person to the proceedings or the person was excluded from third-party proceedings, the ruling in the main proceedings is not legally binding, including with regard to the legal assessment.
4) Is there a binding effect with regard to established facts which the third person could not challenge in the main proceeding e.g. because they were uncontested by the parties?
Circumstances established by the court are not legally binding on the third party if the third party was not able to challenge them because the other parties did not contest them or if the party in whose favour the third party was added to the proceedings did not agree with the circumstances challenged by the third party.
5) Does TPN produce its effects irrespective of whether or not the third person joined in the main proceeding?
Given that, pursuant to Estonian procedural law, a third party is notified only by being served a third party notice issued by one of the parties and not independently, the legal effects will depend on whether or not the third party was added to the proceedings.
6) Does TPN affect the relation between the third person and the opponent of the notifying party?
If a party made an application to have a third party added to proceedings, but the court did not add that third party to the proceedings, this has no impact on relations between the party submitting the application and its opposing party, unless the third party was added to the proceedings.
The addition of a third party not making an independent submission and the consequences thereof are governed by Sections 214 and 216 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
1 What does enforcement mean in civil and commercial matters?
In the Republic of Slovenia, enforcement is uniformly governed by the Enforcement and Securing of Civil Claims Act (Zakon o izvršbi in zavarovanju – ZIZ).
Enforcement means forced execution of an enforceable title by a court, which orders that a claim be performed (to give, to perform, to cease doing or to permit).
Enforcement of a monetary claim is also permitted on the basis of an authentic document.
Exceptionally, enforcement in family matters may involve enforcement of claims in respect of relationships.
2 Which authority or authorities are competent for enforcement?
Courts, specifically the local courts (okrajna sodišča), are competent to allow and execute enforcement.
3 What are the conditions under which an enforceable title or decision may be issued?
A court allows enforcement on the basis of an enforceable title.
Enforceable titles include: an enforceable court decision (a judgment or an arbitration award, decision, a payment or another order of a court or arbitration) and a court settlement (concluded before a court); an enforceable notarial record; and another enforceable decision or a document which is specified as an enforceable title by the law, a ratified and published international treaty or an European Union legal act directly applicable in the Republic of Slovenia.
An enforceable title can be enforced if it contains information about the creditor, debtor and the subject, type, scope and time for performing the obligation (Article 21(1) of the ZIZ).
When an enforceable title is a decision which does not stipulate the time limit for voluntary performance of the obligation, the time limit is determined by a court in its decision of enforcement.
3.1 The procedure Enforcement proceedings and security proceedings start upon a creditor’s request.
The request may be filed directly by a creditor, since representation through a lawyer is not mandatory.
Usually these requests for enforcement are lodged through a lawyer who has relevant legal knowledge.
A local court is competent to hear these cases.
Notwithstanding provisions on territorial jurisdiction, requests for enforcement based on an authentic document are lodged with the Local Court in Ljubljana (Okrajno sodišče v Ljubljani), which rules on them.
Regarding the possibility or necessity of electronic filing of applications in enforcement proceedings, please see the section on ‘automatic processing’.
A court fee must be paid at the time of filing a request for, an objection to, or an appeal against enforcement.
The court fee must be paid within 8 days after the order for the payment of the court fee is served.
If the court fee is not paid within this time limit and there are no conditions to allow for waiving or deferring the fee or paying the fee by instalments, the filing is considered withdrawn.
When a court receives a request for enforcement, it checks whether the request contains all the required elements and then issues a decision on enforcement by which it allows the enforcement or denies the request for enforcement (for being unjustified in substance) or rejects the request for enforcement (for procedural reasons).
The court serves the decision on enforcement on the creditor and the debtor when enforcement is allowed and on the creditor only when it is denied.
The decision on enforcement by which an enforcement agent is appointed or a decision on appointing an enforcement agent is served by the court upon the enforcement agent, together with copies of all the documents required for executing the enforcement.
The court may allow enforcement of a monetary claim by the methods and on those objects which are stated in the request for enforcement.
The court may order enforcement by a different method than the one requested by a creditor when the alternative method would be sufficient to pay the claim.
No appeal may be submitted against a decision denying a creditor’s request for enforcement.
Enforcement takes legal effect before the decision on enforcement becomes final, unless the law stipulates otherwise for specific enforcement measures.
The creditor may not be paid before a decision on enforcement becomes final except in a case of enforcement based on an enforceable title against the debtor’s money kept at a payment institution (enforcement based on enforceable title), provided that the enforceable title is attached to the request for enforcement.
The court appoints an enforcement agent in its decisions allowing enforcement which requires direct enforcement measures.
Enforcement Agents Enforcement agents are persons who conduct direct enforcement and security measures (they physically conduct the enforcement – i.e. they seize property, specify the security, etc.).
Enforcement agents are appointed by the minister responsible for justice.
Their number and place of their establishment are determined by the minister responsible for justice so that there is at least one enforcement agent per district court (okrožno sodiščo) territory, while the remaining enforcement agents are assigned in district court territories according to the number of enforcement cases before local courts within each district court territory.
In individual enforcement cases, an enforcement agent is appointed by a decision of a court, but the creditor has the right to nominate a particular enforcement agent.
In any particular case, an enforcement agent may conduct measures in the entire Republic of Slovenia.
The service of enforcement agents is a public service, which they perform as an independent activity.
Enforcement agents are responsible for any damage they cause when conducting enforcement and security measures by their actions or by failure to fulfil their obligations under the law, its implementing regulations and court orders.
In case of a serious infringement of their obligations, enforcement agents may be discharged by the minister responsible for justice.
Enforcement costs Enforcement costs are first paid by the creditor.
The creditor must also pay an advance for costs of the enforcement measures, in the amount and within the time limits determined by the court.
Where the creditor does not pay the security, the court will stay the enforcement.
The debtor must reimburse the creditor’s costs upon the creditor’s request when the costs were necessary for enforcement, including costs for searches related to the debtor’s property, and costs for proceedings initiated by a court’s own motion.
The court must decide on costs within eight days of receiving a request.
To secure a payment for work and for recovery of costs, the enforcement agent may ask the creditor for a payment for security within a time limit and in the amount set out in the tariff.
The enforcement agent must serve the notice to pay the security on the creditor in person, which must also contain a warning of the consequences if the security is not paid on time and if evidence of payment is not submitted to the enforcement agent. The enforcement agent must also include a notice of his or her right to ask the court to decide about the security.
Where the creditor does not agree with the method of payment, the time limit, or the amount of the security, the creditor may within eight days of receiving the notice submit to the enforcement agent a request for the court to decide the issue.
The enforcement agent must immediately send the request to the court, which must decide on the matter within eight days of its receipt.
When the creditor does not pay the security by the method and within the time limit determined by the enforcement agent or the court, or does not submit evidence of payment, the enforcement agent so informs the court, which will stay the enforcement.
3.2 The main conditions The first condition for allowing enforcement is having the basis for the enforcement. This can be an enforceable title or an authentic document, in accordance with the law.
Enforceability of court decisions: A court decision is enforceable once it becomes final and when the time limit has passed for voluntary performance of the debtor’s obligations.
The time limit for the voluntary performance of the obligation starts the day after the decision was served on the debtor.
It is possible for the court to allow the enforcement of only part of a decision, when that part becomes enforceable.
The court will allow enforcement on the basis of a court decision that is not yet final when the law provides that an appeal does not stay its enforcement.
Enforceability of court settlement: A court settlement is enforceable if the claim in the settlement is due for payment.
Maturity of the claim must be demonstrated in the settlement record, in a public document or a document certified in accordance with the law.
If maturity cannot be demonstrated in this manner, it is demonstrated by a final decision issued in civil proceedings where the maturity of the claim is being established.
Enforceable notarial record: A notarial record is enforceable if the debtor had agreed to its direct enforceability in the record and if the claim set out in the notarial record is due for payment.
The maturity of the claim is demonstrated in a notarial record, a public document or a document certified in accordance with the law.
Where the maturity of the claim does not depend on the expiry of a time limit, but rather on another fact stated in the notarial record, the notary is to notify the parties what is sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the claim is due: the creditor’s written statement to the debtor that the claim is due, stating the date of maturity and evidence of service of the written statement regarding the maturity of the claim on the debtor.
The notary is to notify the parties that they may authorise the notary to inform the debtor of the maturity of the claim instead of submitting evidence of service of a written statement regarding the maturity of the claim on the debtor.
The creditor’s written statement or the notary’s notification are served by registered mail.
In the request for enforcement, a creditor must clearly define the enforceable title on the basis of which the enforcement is sought and state that the declaration of enforceability was issued.
The claim must be due for payment and the time limit for the voluntary performance of the obligation must have passed (voluntary time limit).
The debtor must be clearly identified in the enforceable title or in the authentic document.
In the request for enforcement, the debtor must also be identified by name and address (or established place of business).
The request for enforcement must clearly state the debtor’s (and the creditor’s) identifying information, which differs depending on whether they are natural persons, legal persons, entrepreneurs or private individuals.
The debtor must be an existing entity (he cannot be deceased or struck-off the court register).
Where the request for enforcement is filed against a non-existing entity, it must be dismissed, and the entity ceasing to exist during enforcement proceedings is a reason for staying the proceedings by law (and it is not necessary to issue a special decision).
Presumptions apply (legal capacity) equally to the debtor and the creditor in enforcement proceedings, as they are set out in civil proceedings under the Civil Procedure Act (Zakon o pravdnem postopku), with reference to Article 15 of the ZIZ.
4 Object and nature of enforcement measures The objective of enforcement measures is the payment of the creditor’s claim.
Enforcement measures for paying monetary claims are: the sale of the debtor’s movables, the sale of immovables, the transfer of the debtor’s monetary claim, the redemption of other proprietary or material rights and book-entry securities, the sale of a company member's stake and the transfer of money kept at a payment institution (i.e. banks).
Enforcement measures for paying non-monetary claims are: taking and delivering movables, emptying and taking of immovables, substituting service at the debtor’s expense, forcing a debtor to act through financial penalties, the return of a worker to work, the distribution of movables, declaration of will, and taking a child.
4.1 What types of assets can be subject to enforcement?
The above-listed enforcement measures allow enforcement against any object of enforcement (for any debtor’s object, or proprietary or material right) unless an object is exempt from enforcement by law or the enforcement against an object is limited by law - Article 32 of the ZIZ.
The main objective of all enforceable measures is the payment of the creditor’s claim.
The effects of enforcement measures depend on the type of enforcement measure used.
ENFORCEMENT FOR MONETARY CLAIMS Enforcement against movables is conducted by seizing and selling the movable.
The creditor obtains a lien on the seized objects.
Enforcement against the debtor’s cash receivables is conducted by seizing and transferring the receivables.
By the decision, in which the seizure of cash receivables is allowed (decision on seizure), the court prohibits the debtor’s debtor to pay the debt to the debtor and the debtor to claim the receivables, including from the lien given as a security, or to dispose of the receivables in any other manner.
Seizure takes effect on the day the decision on seizure is served on the debtor’s debtor.
By seizing the debtor’s receivables, authorised by the court upon the creditor’s request, the creditor obtains a lien on seized receivables.
Enforcement against debtor’s money kept at a payment organisation: By a decision on enforcement against money kept by the debtor with a payment organisation, the court orders the payment organisation to freeze the debtor’s money in all accounts, up to the amount payable under the decision on enforcement, and after the decision becomes final, to pay that amount to the creditor.
The decision has the effect of seizure and transfer for recovery.
When the decision on enforcement becomes final, the court informs the payment organisation.
The payment organisation informs the court immediately after paying the creditor.
Enforcement for a receivable that movables are taken or supplied or that immovable are delivered is conducted by seizing that receivable and transferring it to the creditor, followed by its sale.
The transfer of the debtor’s seized receivable has the effect of a transfer of the debtor’s monetary receivable.
Enforcement against other proprietary or material rights is conducted by seizing that right and realising the movable.
Seizure takes effect on the day the decision on seizure is served upon the debtor.
In the decision of enforcement, by which the seizure is allowed, the court prohibits the debtor from disposing of the right.
Upon seizure of the right, a creditor obtains a lien.
Enforcement against book-entry securities: Enforcement of book-entry securities traded on the stock exchange is conducted by seizure and sale of book-entry securities and by paying the creditor from the amount obtained from the sale.
Seizure takes effect on the day the decision on seizure is registered in the central register of book-entry securities.
Enforcement against a company member's stake is conducted by registering a decision of enforcement, by selling the stake and paying the creditor the amount obtained from the sale.
By the decision on enforcement, the court prohibits a member from disposing of its stake.
The court serves the decision of enforcement on the company and registers it in the court register.
By this registration, the creditor acquires a lien on the member's stake, having effect also against any person who subsequently acquires that stake.
Enforcement against immovables is conducted by registering a decision of enforcement in the land registry, by determining the value of the immovable, selling it, and paying the creditor from the amount obtained from the sale.
The court registers the decision of enforcement against the immovable in the land registry.
By this registration, the creditor acquires a lien on the immovable, having effect against any person who subsequently acquires proprietary right in it.
A creditor who requests enforcement but has not yet acquired a lien or land debt, by registering the decision of enforcement, acquires the right of payment from the immovable before a person who later acquired a lien or a land debt.
ENFORCEMENT FOR NON-MONETARY CLAIMS The delivering and supplying movables process is conducted by an enforcement agent taking the object from the debtor and giving it to the creditor against a receipt.
The emptying and taking of an immovable process is conducted by an enforcement agent taking the immovable for the creditor’s possession after it is cleared of people and objects.
The emptying and taking of the immovable is permitted 8 days after the decision of enforcement is served on the debtor.
The obligation to do, to permit or to cease doing something process may be conducted in cooperation with an enforcement agent by the method determined by the court.
On the basis of an enforceable title, under which the debtor must do something which can be performed by someone else, enforcement takes place by the court authorising the creditor to entrust the task to someone else at the debtor’s expense or to perform it him or herself (substitute service at the debtor's expense).
When the debtor must do something under the enforceable title which cannot be done by anyone else, the court stipulates a suitable time limit for performing this obligation in the decision of enforcement, and issues a fine if the debtor does not perform the obligation within the time limit (forcing a debtor through a fine).
The return of worker to work process is conducted by the court stipulating a suitable time limit for performing the obligations in the decision of enforcement.
In the decision on enforcement, the court also issues a fine if the debtor does not perform the obligation within the time limit.
The Distribution of object process may take place by the actual physical distribution when such a distribution is determined by enforceable title or through a sale of the object; The declaration of will process is an obligation to give a land-registry or another type of declaration of will, as stipulated in the decision which is an enforceable title, is regarded as being performed once that decision is final.
The enforcement in cases regarding custody or upbringing of children and personal contacts with children process is where the court stipulates in the decision of enforcement that a person must hand over a child.
The court sets a time limit within which the child must be handed over or decides that the child must be handed over immediately.
By the decision of enforcement, the obligation to hand over a child is ordered upon the person to whom the enforceable title refers, upon the person on whose will the handing-over of the child depends and upon the person who is with the child at the time the decision is issued.
In the decision of enforcement, the court orders that the obligation to hand over the child takes effect against anyone with whom the child is at the time the enforcement is executed.
Where the debtor acts contrary to the decision of enforcement and disposes of his property, such a transaction is valid only if the legal act was for valuable consideration and if the other party acted in good faith (i.e. did not know or could not have known that the debtor did not have the right to dispose of his property) at the time of the transfer or encumbrance.
A debtor who destroys, damages, transfers or hides part of their property with the intention of preventing a payment to a creditor, and by doing so harms the creditor, is criminally liable and will be fined or receive a prison sentence of up to one year.
A bank must, upon the court’s request, provide an explanation and documentation demonstrating whether and how it executed a court’s decision of enforcement and how it applied the order of repaying claims as mandated by law.
The bank must also send information on the debtor’s bank accounts to creditors and the court.
On the basis of a decision of enforcement, a bank must freeze the debtor’s money held at the bank in the amount set out in the decision of enforcement and then pay this amount to the creditor.
Upon the creditor’s request, a court may order a bank, which contrary to the court’s decision did not execute seizure, transfer or pay the amount due, to pay this amount to the creditor instead of the debtor from the bank’s own assets.
In such a case, the bank is responsible to the creditor for damage caused by not acting in accordance with the decision of enforcement or for breaching the statutory provisions on the obligation to disclose information, on respecting the sequence order of payment, on the amount and the manner of paying the obligation under the decision of enforcement.
On the basis of a decision of enforcement, the debtor’s employer must pay the creditor a lump sum of money or regularly pay the creditor the sums of money to which the debtor would otherwise be entitled as salary.
Nevertheless, the debtor must receive no less than 70 % of the minimum salary per month.
Upon the creditor’s request, the court may order the employer, which contrary to the court’s decision did not withhold and pay amounts due, to pay such amounts to the creditor instead of the debtor from the employer’s own assets.
In such a case, the employer is responsible to the creditor for damage caused by not acting in accordance with the decision of enforcement.
A debtor’s debtor must declare if s/he recognises a receivable seized and in which amount, and if their obligation for paying the debtor’s receivable is conditional on the performance of any other obligation.
If s/he does not make a declaration or does not declare the truth, s/he is responsible to the creditor for the damage.
4.3 What is the validity of such measures?
The time validity of a particular measure of an enforcement court depends on the nature of the measure.
Enforcement proceedings (and the effects of a decision allowing enforcement) are generally resolved when the creditor’s claim is satisfied.
If enforcement is not feasible for legal or factual reasons, it must be resolved by staying the enforcement, which has the effect of annulling all enforcement measures except when doing so would interfere with the rights that third parties had acquired (for example, the rights of buyers to seized movables).
The creditor may request that enforcement be deferred for a maximum of one year and if so, the decision allowing enforcement remains in force even when the debtor does not have any property at the time of the issuing of the decision (i.e. the existence of factual hurdles preventing the realisation of the creditor’s claim).
Where there is no money available, in the case of enforcement against the debtor’s receivables from the debtor’s bank accounts, or the debtor cannot access the money, the bank must keep the decision of enforcement in its records for one year and pay the creditor when the money is available in the debtor’s account or when the debtor obtains the right to dispose of the money.
Until then, the enforcement may not be stayed.
Until then, the enforcement may not be stayed.
5 Is there a possibility of appeal against the decision granting such a measure?
The debtor, the creditor, any third party with a right to the object of enforcement which prevents the enforcement, and any buyer of an object purchased in the proceedings, all have a right to file legal remedies against the decisions of the enforcement court.
The typical legal remedy against a decision of first instance is an appeal.
Exceptionally, an objection may be filed against a decision of enforcement by the debtor or a third party with a right to the object of enforcement which prevents the enforcement.
The objection must be justified.
In the objection, the debtor or the third party must state all the facts and submit evidence on the basis of which the objection should be justified (debtor’s objection).
The creditor has the right to reply to the objection within 8 days.
A decision on the objection can be appealed.
Anyone who demonstrates that they likely have a right to the object of enforcement which prevents enforcement may lodge an objection against the decision of enforcement and request that the court declare that the enforcement against that object is not permitted (third party objection).
The objection may be filed until the end of the enforcement proceedings.
Where the creditor does not reply to the objection within the time limit or declares that it does not oppose the objection, the court will annul the decision of enforcement in full or in part and stay the enforcement, depending on the circumstances of the case.
Where the creditor does declare that s/he opposes the objection within the time limit, the court will refuse the objection.
The third party that had filed the objection may initiate a lawsuit within 30 days after the decision becomes final to establish whether the enforcement is allowed on the object.
An appeal and an objection may be filed with the court that issued the decision against which legal remedy is sought.
As a general rule, the same court that issued the decision of enforcement decides on an objection, and the court of second instance decides on an appeal.
A decision on the appeal is final.
An objection and an appeal must be filed within eight days from the service of the decision of the court of first instance.
Exceptionally, an objection may be lodged after this time limit, until the end of enforcement proceedings, when the objection is based on a fact concerning the actual claim and this fact arose after enforceability of the decision and it was not possible to assert it within the initial time limit.
An objection and an appeal do not stay the execution of enforcement measures in enforcement proceedings except for the payment phase.
As a general rule, the creditor cannot be paid until the decision of enforcement is final.
The creditor may be paid before the decision on enforcement becomes final only in a case of enforcement based on an enforceable title when enforcement is for the debtor’s money kept at a payment institution (enforcement based on enforceable title), provided that the enforceable title is attached to the request for enforcement, except in commercial matters where the enforceable title need not be attached.
In enforcement proceedings, exceptional legal remedies are limited.
6 Are there any limitations on enforcement, in particular related to debtor protection or time limits?
