Comhshuimiú pinsean i gcomhair PSPR Ó 1 Meán Fómhair 2013, tá PSPR i bhfeidhm ar an tsuim chomhiomlán pinsean nuair atá duine ag fáil dhá phinsean seirbhíse poiblí nó níos mó (de bhun ballraíocht scéim pinsean seirbhíse poiblí amháin nó níos mó nó mar Chéile/Páirtí Sibhialta seirbhísigh phoiblí a bhásaigh) agus nuair: a) atá gach pinsean faoi réir na rátaí céanna PSPR, agus b) atá luach comhlán gach pinsin (roimh asbhaintí PSPR) níos mó ná €32,500.	A pension for SMR from 1 September 2013, the CFCA has been applied to pension pensions when individuals making two or more public service schemes (pursuant to membership of a public service scheme or more or more), which are of every pension, subject to the same rates of public service schemes and to (b) the value of all pensions (before the EAW) exceeds EUR 32,500.	0.8175016664314632	0.48032629605300015
